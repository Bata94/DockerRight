# DockerBackup

This is a simple Docker Container that allows you to monitor your Docker Containers and backup your Docker Volumes, with notifictaions.

It creates a tarball per configured volume, at the configured time, and stores it in the configured location :)
In the best case the Output directory is mapped to a Network Drive or another Host.

Not recommended to use for DBs or complex applications, but still better than no backup at all :D
Use at your own risk!

## How to use
